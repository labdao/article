# Article
This repository is designed to outline the process for proposing and writing articles for labDAO, as well as hosting completed and distributed articles. 

## Article Process 
GitHub issues are used to propose new article topics and record feedback, while DeWork is used to keep track of progress and bounties. New to GitHub and DeWork, check out these resources below (more coming soon)
### Proposing a topic:
#### GitHub: 
1. Create a new issue with a proposed topic (big green button on the top left) 
    * *Task is automatically created in [DeWork](https://app.dework.xyz/o/labdao-3bt1rpGt1z7a1W2ld7B8oA/p/article-7zzuriFc77xqiZdQIYRT7D) article board*         
2. Assign yourself and any other contributors to the issue in GitHub and task in DeWork 

#### Feedback
3. Wait for feedback and approval from the labDAO core members (given in the GitHub Issue)    
      * *DeWork Task is moved to "In Progress"*
      * *DeWork admin sets bounty in DeWork task* 
#### Important:
Before starting a draft, please wait for feedback and approval from the labDAO team. We what to make sure everyone's time is rewarded and valuable to labDAOâ€™s mission. 
### Creating an article: 
4. Post your article draft as a file in this repository yyyymm_lastname_title.md.

    * *DeWork Task gets moved to "Done"*      
    * *GitHub issue is closed*

## FAQ
### Why do we use git to write?      
Git is a version control system designed to facilitate collaboration between software develops. It is the best tool to enable a large group of contributors to agree on a shared truth and contribute in a decentralized way. Software developers communicate with computers using code - Writers communicate with humans using natural language. In a decentralized community, like LabDAO, keeping track of activities publicly ensures maximum inclusivity. We want everybody to be able to contribute in the writing process and open pull requests with changes. Even though there will most likely always be a team focused on the task of writing a newsletter, doing it out in the open with everybody able to suggest structured improvements is important. Instead of hiring members, like in a traditional company, we simply onboard organic contributors.           

#### How do we use git to write?      
Git can be a bit finicky. The easiest work with it is to go to the labdao/newsletter repository in your browser and press the "." button. This will open an IDE where you can edit the article and commit your changes. If you and others want to work on the repository at the same time, the best way to do this is to use hackmd.io, a collaborative markdown editor that feels like github and google docs had a baby. You can save your results on hackmd.io and push your changes to Github.
